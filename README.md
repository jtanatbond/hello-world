Example: Contribute to an existing repository

# download a repository on GitHub.com to our machine
git clone https://github.com/me/repo.git

# change into the `repo` directory
cd repo

# create a new branch to store any new changes
git branch my-branch

# switch to that branch (line of development)
git checkout my-branch

# make changes, for example, edit `file1.md` and `file2.md` using the text editor

# stage the changed files
git add file1.md file2.md

# take a snapshot of the staging area (anything that's been added)
git commit -m "my snapshot"

# push changes to github
git push --set-upstream origin my-branch


git diff --word-diff


Rules to live by for commit messages:

    Donâ€™t end your commit message with a period.
    Keep your commit messages to 50 characters or less. Add extra detail in the extended description window if necessary. This is located just below the subject line.
    Use active voice. For example, "add" instead of "added" and "merge" instead of "merged".
    Think of your commit as expressing intent to introduce a change.
